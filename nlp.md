### Welcome

Welcome to the Basics of Natural Language Processing workshop! On this page you will find everything you need for this workshop. The Workshop is divided into two parts. First, you are invited to watch the videos below and follow along the Google Colab Notebooks I have prepared for you. Second, you are invited to attend a live session via Zoom for more hands-on exercises and a time for Q & A. There are two options for attending the live session:
* Friday May 14 at 2:00pm (EST) (see below for Zoom link)
* Saturday May 15 at 2:00pm (EST) (see below for Zoom link)
